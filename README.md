# 👋

I build systems that are meant to keep running.

Some of them process data.  
Some of them simulate worlds.

All of them care deeply about consistency, boundaries, and what happens after the first elegant solution stops being sufficient.


## 🧠 Biases

- Systems should behave the same way tomorrow as they do today  
- If something only works when everything goes right, it doesn’t work  
- Illusions are fragile, simulations are honest


## 🛠️ Mediums

- server-authoritative sim architectures  
- deterministic or quasi-deterministic simulation  
- tooling that prefers being boring over being clever  


## 🌌 Lately

I’ve been exploring what it means to build a persistent system, one that continues to evolve whether anyone is watching or not.

Things like:
- delayed consequences  
- actions that echo across time  
- scale that feels real instead of theatrical  
- worlds that can be reasoned about, not just rendered  

Some of this work is visible.  
Some of it is intentionally quiet.


## 🧭 Working style

- Start with invariants  
- Write for future readers  
- Optimize for durability, not demos  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness


## 📡

If you’re here because you care about:
- large-scale systems
- simulation-heavy games
- thoughtful engineering
- or ambitious side projects that are trying to grow up properly

…we’re probably aligned.
